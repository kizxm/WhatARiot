_WhatARiot is a simple app made for accessing different game datas from the healthy and family friendly game league of legends._

_(10/26) All entries/inputs for the filtering build MUST be capitalized,_

```ex. '*j*anna' -> will return nothing
ex. '*J*anna' -> will return champion information
```

_(10/25) CURRENTLY in `Constants.Java` you have the choice to search by either of two builds: `sorting build` for a full list of champions arranged by attribute or `filtering build` for returning a single champion. notation for accessing a sample of each is below._
