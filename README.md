## Description


![Alt text](img/blueboard.png)


>WhatARiot is a simple app made for accessing different game datas from the healthy and family friendly game league of legends and is currently still in progress!!!.
>
>FOR FUTURE it would be nice if the entered champion information is wrong that the entire list of champions is returned.

_(10/27) App is currently configured for the filtering build! Please note filtering build notation! Only Correct capitalized champion names are currently recognized!!!_

_(10/26) All entries/inputs for the filtering build **MUST** be capitalized!!_

```
ex. 'janna' -> will return nothing
ex. 'Janna' -> will return champion information
```

_(10/25) CURRENTLY in `Constants.Java` you have the choice to search by either of two builds:
`sorting build` for a full list of champions arranged by attribute or
`filtering build` for returning a single champion. notation for accessing a sample of each is below._
